## My process

- build html
- create css
- check and verify frequently with Firefox and its developer console
- consulting my own notes regarding usage of tags/options, consulting developers.mozilla.org and w3schools


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- editor: visual studio code

### What I learned
More about positioning items inside flex. Used clamp first time to make font-size responsive with vw. Discovered the command "white-space" to avoid line break in an expression.

### Continued development
Using clamp more frequntly, paying more attention to responsiveness.


### Useful resources

developers.mozilla.org
w3schools
